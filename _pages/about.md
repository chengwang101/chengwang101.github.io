Welcome! I am a research scientist at Shandong University developing machine learning methods for omics biomarker discovery. I completed my PhD specialized in computational biology in 2020 under the advisory of Prof. Rafael Brüschweiler at The Ohio State University, USA. 
My PhD research focused on developing computational methods for the identification of small molecules (metabolites and drugs) by combining metabolomics data and cheminformatics methods. After that, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Gary Patti's lab at Washington University in St. Louis, with a focus on integrating machine learning and multi-omics data to predict enzymatic reactions and drug-like molecule properties. To date, I have published my work in a number of top-tier journals such as Briefings in bioinformatics, Analytical Chemistry.

My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in the
*Briefings in bioinformatics*, *Analytical Chemistry*,
*Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, and
*Journal of Translational Medicine*, among other outlets. This
[research](research) leverages machine learning models such as graph neural network for small molecule identification.
