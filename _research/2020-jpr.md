## Abstract

![Toc](/images/research/2020-jpr.png)

> Accurate identification of lipids in biological samples is a key step in lipidomics studies. Multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool for this purpose as it provides comprehensive structural information on lipid composition at atomic resolution. However, the interpretation of NMR spectra of complex lipid mixtures is currently hampered by limited spectral resolution and the absence of a customized lipid NMR database along with user-friendly spectral analysis tools. We introduce a new two-dimensional (2D) NMR metabolite database “COLMAR Lipids” that was specifically curated for hydrophobic metabolites presently containing 501 compounds with accurate experimental 2D 13C-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) chemical shift data measured in CDCl3. A new module in the public COLMAR suite of NMR web servers was developed for the (semi)automated analysis of complex lipidomics mixtures (http://spin.ccic.osu.edu/index.php/colmarm/index2). To obtain 2D HSQC spectra with the necessary high spectral resolution along both 13C and 1H dimensions, nonuniform sampling in combination with pure shift spectroscopy was applied allowing the extraction of an abundance of unique cross-peaks belonging to hydrophobic compounds in complex lipidomics mixtures. As shown here, this information is critical for the unambiguous identification of underlying lipid molecules by means of the new COLMAR Lipids web server, also in combination with mass spectrometry, as is demonstrated for Caco-2 cell and lung tissue cell extracts.
